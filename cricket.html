    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Test Batting </p>
    for starters i scraped all individual test batting innings from espncricinfo (goated website). this includes every test innings from every batsmen including ICC World XI matches. <br>

    this is a cool starting place. so ive plotted not out innings in red, out in black. immediately i look to the top and see Brian Lara's 400* in 2004 and the massive gaps when the world wars were on. <br>
    the next thing i see, is the lines of not out at 100 and 200. this makes a lot of sense captains will let there batsmen get 100*/200* before declaring. <br>
    finally, there appears to be a general trend upward, this could be due to a few things: better bats, more games with more nations, the improvement of tail enders batting. <br>
    we can check further this last point by looking at the mean score each year. <br>

    <img style="max-width: 600px; max-height: 400px" src="sportStatImages/meanTestInningsByYearbyInnings.png"><br>
    looking at these graphs, the difference before and after ww2 is clear. after the mean score by innings is generally 1st > 2nd > 3rd > 4th, and they all follow a similar trend. <br>
    before they are all over the joint. in 1939 the 4th innings average was 47.9 more then 15 better then the 1st innings average, the next year it was 14.2. <br> 
    perhaps some future charts will only focus on pre/post ww2, will specify in title. <br>
    <br>
    i just realised this i calculated all these averages as total/runs over number of innings and not total runs/number of outs. <br>
