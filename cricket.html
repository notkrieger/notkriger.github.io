    cricket is one of the best sports on Earth. the tension, the drama, the skill, the stats, the drinking. it has truly got something for everybody. <br>
    in this page i will put some of the interesting cricket stats ive found. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Test Batting </p>
    for starters i scraped all individual test batting innings from espncricinfo (goated website). this includes every test innings from every batsmen including ICC World XI matches. <br>

    this is a cool starting place. so ive plotted not out innings in red, out in black. immediately i look to the top and see Brian Lara's 400* in 2004 and the massive gaps when the world wars were on. <br>
    the next thing i see, is the lines of not out at 100 and 200. this makes a lot of sense captains will let there batsmen get 100*/200* before declaring. <br>
    finally, there appears to be a general trend upward, this could be due to a few things: better bats, more games with more nations, the improvement of tail enders batting. <br>
    we can check further this last point by looking at the mean score each year. <br>

    firstly wow cricket must have sucked in 1888, an average batting score of 9.266. just exhilerating im sure. ofc i know cricket from 1888 and today are effectively different sports, still funny. <br>
    anyway, this suggests to me that the apparent increase in the first plot is purely because there is more cricket, not an apparent increase in skill. <br>
    i mean the don is the nearly twice as good as the next best batsmen of all time and he played nearly 100 years ago, so i guess i shouldnt have expected this. <br>
