    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Test Batting </p>
    for starters i scraped all individual test batting innings from espncricinfo (goated website). this includes every test innings from every batsmen including ICC World XI matches. <br>
    <img style="max-width: 800px; max-height: 600px" src="sportStatImages/everyTestInningsBubble.png"><br>
    this is a cool starting place. so ive plotted not out innings in red, out in black. immediately i look to the top and see Brian Lara's 400* in 2004 and the massive gaps when the world wars were on. <br>
    the next thing i see, is the lines of not out at 100 and 200. this makes a lot of sense captains will let there batsmen get 100*/200* before declaring. <br>
    finally, there appears to be a general trend upward, this could be due to a few things: better bats, more games with more nations, the improvement of tail enders batting. <br>
    we can check further this last point by looking at the mean score each year. <br>
