    so in last few years ive rly gotten into surfing. its heaps of fun, keeps you fit, challenges you to whatever level you wish. the list goes on. <br>
    as someone holding a undergrad in physics, ive always been curious about how it actually works. <br>
    so this will be ongoing notebook of sorts, where I will put infomation ive learnt about the physics of surfing for other people to see. <br>
</p>

<p>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> 1 - Ocean Waves </p>
    the first thing you need to surf is a wave. where i live this is normally easy. but how do waves form? and under what conditions do they break? <br>
    <br>
    waves are generally formed from strong winds created by large storms deep in the ocean.* 
    it is important to remember that waves move energy not water. <br>
    think about a seagull floating at sea, in unbroken waves, it doesnt get pushed in the direction of travel of the waves, it seems to mostly stay in place (forget the effects of currents and wind). <br>
    now imagine the seagull is a single water molecule, the water is not rly moving, but the energy is. <br>
    <br>
    on a side note, these storms are also responsible for we surfers call sets. effectively waves which hit beaches will appear to come in cycles, a couple good ones, then a preiod of messier waves, then more good ones, etc. <br>
    this occurs because these ocean storms make waves of different frequencies, the frequency of a wave determines its speed of propagation. <br>
    so a set occurs when a bunch of these different frequency waves constructively interfere near the shore and the break is the opposite. 
    <br>
    so now we want to know why the waves break. originally i wanted to try and simulate this, but it turns out CFD rly struggles with broken waves because it cannot reproduce the air bubbles which get formed. <br>
    <br>
    *other sources do exist such as earthquakes and other impact events.

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> 2 - Surfboards </p>
    the physics of surfing rly comes down to a couple things: speed and grip. speed is pre self explanatory and grip refers to the grip between the board and water. <br>
    you may be surprised to find water is actually quite "grippy",
