    I have always found cellular automata cool, from wolframs elementary ca to conways game of life. <br>
    here are some i coded up and explored. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Langton's Ant </p>
    The original Langtons ant is a simple 2d cellular automata where the grid can be colour 0 or 1 and the ant (the only active thing) follows these 2 rules: <br>
    if the current cell is 0, change it to 1, rotate (-)90 degrees left and move forward.  <br>
    if the current cell is 1, change it to 0, rotate (+)90 degrees right and move forward. <br>
    This is the first 11,500 steps the ant will take. After 11,000ish it begins to forming a repeating pattern which will continue indefintely. <br>

    <br>
    it is not hard to make variations to Langtons Ant by adding more options for cell values (more colours) and more rules. <br>
    on the left I have the rules: {0-->1,+90, 1-->3,+90, 2-->0,-90, 3-->2,-90} and on the right: {0-->3,+90, 1-->0,+90, 2-->1,-90, 3-->4,-90,4-->2,+90}. <br>

    <br>
    i have seen videos online where people have found awesome patterns just by modifying the number of colours and the rules. <br>
    other modifications i have seen are multiple ants at once and a 3d version, which both make the system much more complicated. <br>
    <br>
    i tried something i had not seen before and converted to grid made up of equilateral triangles. this was fun to code up, i used pygame. <br>

    below are the standard 2-colour and 3 colour ants on a triangular grid. the 2-colour ant was suprising, i was expecting a cycle to form like the square grid but after 250 million steps it still didnt happen. <br>
    i am going to run a similar program without the animation that tracks some number like the rate of change of the proportion of white to black and see if it stabilises after some massive number. <br>
