            Conto cliffs, lucky bay, wave rock and a cool frog. Just some of the awesome 
            things awaiting you in Western Australia. <br><br>

            Whether you're looking for crazy adventures or relaxing afternoons on the beach, Western Australia
            has got something for everybody. From the ripper surf and beautiful winieries near the Margaret River 
            region to some of the oldest Aboriginal sites near Wave Rock, Hyden.
            Don't forget about some of the awesome wildlife around, Western Australia is home to a few species 
            which can't be found anywhere else in the world such as the quokka and ringtail possum. As well as 
            many others like the emu, red-tailed black cockatoo, red kangaroos and so much more.
            Vastly different to the rest of the country WA should be on top of everyones bucket list locations.
