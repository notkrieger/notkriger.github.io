    a collection of fractals i made in python <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Chaos Game</p>
    <br>
    the chaos game is very simple. you have N vertices, normally arranged in a regular N-gon. each vertex is assigned a probability, lets say 1/N. <br>
    now starting at a random point. pick a random vertex based on the probabilities and move to the point halfway between your current position and that vertex. <br>
    repeat.<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    if done with 3 points you get the famous Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. <br>

    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/5gon.png">
    <br>
    you can do this to create a fractal with any number of points except 4. this happens because the quadrants of a square are identical to the larger square. 
    so no matter where the point is, it is possible to move to any other quadrant. <br>
    
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/4gon.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/whyno4.png">  <br>
    as a result of this there is a series of steps which can move between any two points 
    inside the square, which means eventually every point will be reached. this does not happen with any other shape. <br>
    the larger N is the more unclear the fractal pattern is.
    <br>
    next i thought what if i didnt allow it to pick the same point twice in a row. <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/notwice_3gon.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/notwice_4gon.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/notwice_5gon.png">
    <br> very cool, 3 points is no longer connected, 4 now has fractal behaviour and 5 just looks awesome. <br>
    next at step i didnt let it pick the vertex to its right. <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/noright_3gon.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/noright_4gon.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/noright_6gon.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/noright_10gon.png">
    <br> quite nice i especially like the 10 point one in this case. i did some other stuff but nothing i had not seen elsewhere.

    <br><br> last thing on the chaos game, the Barnsley fern. <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/attempt2 banrsley.png">
    <br> i cbf explaining it here but check out the wiki, really intuitive explanation. <br> 
    with just a few tweaks, i modified it to make a tree <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/barnely tree attemt 2.png"> <br>
    i find this super interesting because i think it is somewhat representative of what happens in nature.
    its easier to store a couple equations and have the ability to build from scratch, rather then have to copy and store the entire plan every new generation. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Mandelbrot Set + other similar </p>
    the most famous fractal, the Mandelbrot Set, i remember watching "10e24 deepest mandelbrot zoom ever" videos on youtube as a kid. <br>
    then you learn the process making all that complexity is literally one equation z = z^2 + c. <br>
    anyway everyone seen it already so im not gonna show my low res python generated version, but i will show some of its deranged cousins. <br>
    perhaps the best known of these is the burning ship fractal. it is generated by squaring the sum of the real and complex components of z. z = (Re(z) + Im(z)j)^2 + c <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/burning ship.png">
    <br> ok what if i change the exponent of the burning ship? <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/h.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/i.png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/j.png">
    <br> it looks contnuous i wonder if i can animate it morphing between them? this is z = (Re(z) + Im(z)j)^m + c with m from 1 to 6 and the original z = z^m + c with m = 1 to 5 <br>

    <video autoplay loop muted width="600" height="400" src="fractalImages/mandelbrot.mp4"></video>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br> so then i think why limit myself to only changing the exponent and started putting some really weird equations in the original mandelbrot iteration formula. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Newton fractals </p>
    <br>
    firstly go check out 3blue1brown video on newton fractals, it is what inspired me to make my own. <br> 
    the premise is based on newtons method for solving the roots of a polynimial but applied to a complex funciton. <br>
    so for each point in the complex plane apply newtons method iteratively. this will end up at one the roots of the equation. if we give each root a colour and colour the plance depending on which root each point ended at. <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/basicNewton.png">
    <br> pretty cool. 
    <br> i tried with lots of other equations, some using complex coefficients, etc. here are some. <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/vwvf (1).png">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="fractalImages/freaky.png"> <br>
    <br> but i want to try make an animation like i did for mandelbrot. i think more about how i want to do this.
