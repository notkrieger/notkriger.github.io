    a collection of fractals i made in python <br>

    <br> 
    fractals are weird shapes. my first experience with fractals was as a child learning about the mandelbrot set. 
    while i didnt know the method behind it, i watched many videos on mandelbrot zooms as a kid. 
    now im old enough to understand the iterative processes which create fractals, so here are some which i have made.

    i would like to create a new fractal some day (as in a new process to create one) but have not figured one out yet.
