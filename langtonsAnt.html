    I have always found cellular automata cool, from wolframs elementary ca to conways game of life. <br>
    here is a small exploration of langtons ant. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> Langton's Ant </p>
    The original Langtons ant is a simple 2d cellular automata where the grid can be colour 0 or 1 and the ant (the only active thing) follows these 2 rules: <br>
    if the current cell is 0, change it to 1, rotate (-)90 degrees left and move forward.  <br>
    if the current cell is 1, change it to 0, rotate (+)90 degrees right and move forward. <br>
    This is the first 11,500 steps the ant will take. After 11,000ish it begins to forming a repeating pattern (or a highway) which will continue indefintely. I realise now i mixed my left and rights up so this is "upside down" :). <br>

    <br>

    it is not hard to make variations to Langtons Ant by adding more options for cell values (more colours) and more rules. <br>
    on the left I have the rules: {0-->1,+90, 1-->3,+90, 2-->0,-90, 3-->2,-90} and on the right: {0-->3,+90, 1-->0,+90, 2-->1,-90, 3-->4,-90,4-->2,+90}. <br>

    <br>
    these first few are made using matplotlib so the colours are harder to customise, so i will look to do the rest in pygame. <br>
    i have seen videos online where people have found awesome patterns just by modifying the number of colours and the rules. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7HhZUeKppk" target="_blank"> this video</a> shows some awesome ones with 16 rules. <br>
    other modifications i have seen are multiple ants at once and a 3d version, which both make the system much more complicated. <br>
    <br> <br>
    i tried something i had not seen before and converted to grid made up of equilateral triangles. this was satisfying to code up. <br>
    i also made the grpahics better, so grey cells are untouched cells but for the ant they are treated the same as white. <br>

    above are the standard 2-state ant on a triangular grid. the result was suprising, i was expecting a cycle to form like the square grid but after 100 million steps it still didnt happen. <br>
    the end result looks extremely symmetrical, a few differences can be seen in the central chaotic cluster, looking at the starting video it is clealy not symmetrical. <br>
    because of these slight differences i thought it would eventually become asymmetric but i didnt see that happen after 100 million steps. <br>
    i am going to make and run a modfied ant program without animation that tracks the proportion of white to black and see if it stabilises in a reasonable number of steps (as reasonable as my laptop can handle). <br>

    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/bvsw props log plot.png"><br>
    these the results from said trial. the limiting factor is the grid size, my laptop cannot handle grid above 2500*5000 (the shape has to be like this to tile the full plane with the triangular grid style i used). <br>
    while this is not indicative of a highway as i initially hoped, the growing star pattern could be a sort of stable solution. <br>   
    *note after the fact: perhaps it would have been faster to see if a repeating pattern like the original langton ant can even occur at all in a triangular grid. but im not sure how i would go about this either. 
    and even if it is possible to construct such a pattern, it is a different question to determine if the 2-state ant will ever reach it. <br> <br>

    just for shits and giggles i ran the 2-state again with periodic boundaries to guarantee a break in the pattern. this was done ona 250x500 grid. yes i accidentally inverted the colour scheme. <br>
    <video autoplay loop muted width="600" height="400" src="ant/triangle periodic bondaries sped up.mp4 "></video><br> 
    ok wtf i ran this for 250 mil steps, there are multiple times in the simulation where a clear asymmetry is created. and yet the overall pattern stays so solid. even to the point these asymmetries get repaired. <br>
    the central chaos cluster appears to grow and shrink after the border has been reached. will this cluster eventually consume the entire grid? instinctually, i immediately think yes, it must, but this trianglular ant has made me wonder. <br>
    this work (without any real quantative analysis or proof) has led me to theorise that the 2-state langton ant on a non-periodic triangular grid will never form a highway. <br><br>


    moving on, now i am going to generalise my code by defining an ant by a sequence of L's and R's. so the original 2-state langton ant can be described as "RL" (or in my case above "LR"). <br>
    so for some string S of L's and R's, for any cell state i, the ant changes it the state (i+1)%N, where N is the length of the string S. this allows for easier testing of more complicated rules. <br>
    my goal is to try and find a highway on the triangular grid. this is easier said then done, for any N there are 2<sup>N</sup> possible ants and most of them result in seeming randomness. <br>
    i looped through the positive numbers in binary and converted those to RL strings, then ran the ant >2.5 million steps. here are a bunch of my results. <br> 
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/42.jpeg" title="RLRLRL, 2-state-like">
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/141.jpeg" title="RLLLRRLR"> 
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/298.jpeg" title="RLLRLRLRL, seeming randomness with small areas of order"> <br>
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/384.jpeg" title="RRLLLLLLL, this ones just fucken sick"> 
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/98.jpeg" title="RRLLLRL"> 
    <img style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 300px" src="ant/410.jpeg" title="RRLLRRLRL, first highway i found"> <br>
    so as far as i can see the ants form 4 general patterns. <br>
    1. 2-state-like patterns, these generally occur with a rule like "RLRLRL" (top left) <br>
    2. hexagonal patterns. not sure what makes these to occur but they come in 2 forms: <br>
    2a. layered hexagon pattern (bottom left) <br>
    2b. random hexagon (top middle), these do seem to have layers when being constructed but also get removed and replaced w randomness in construction. <br>
    3. fully random patterns, no obvious shape. these are by far the most frequent. generally completely random (bottom middle), occasionally have some order like middle left. <br>
    4. highway/stable patterns (bottom right), this is the only one i found so far :) <br>

    <br>
    the apparent order in the random patterns could arise because of when the program was stopped. perhaps running another 1000 steps wouldve changed it to randomness. <br>
    of course by this same token of thought, there could be many highways which occur with simpler rules but require >10 million steps to begin. <br>
    overall im pre satisfied with what i produced here. i found a highway, which for a while there i wasnt even sure that was possible. <br>
    im gonna keep running the ants perhaps upto 1024 or even 2048 and will share any more interesting results i find. <br>
    <br>
    in the future  i might make a hexagonal grid ant. this would be the last of the regular n-gons which can tile the plane. <br>
    since the actual shape of the tile doesnt matter i could also look into pentagonal tilings which use identical irregular n-gons. <br>
    it will get a bit more difficult beyond hexagons because i don think you can tile the plane with an n-gon where n>6. <br>
