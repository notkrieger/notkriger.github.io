    some of my methods for solving some porject euler problems. <br>
    spoilers ahead if you want to try for yourself do not look at pictures. <br>
    it is very unlikely these are optimals solutions. <br><br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> 31 - Coin Sums </p>
    how many ways can you make $2 using the following coins: {1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, $1, $2}? <br>
    <br>
    initial thoughts, i'll define p(n) to be the number of ways you can reach n using the set of coins. <br>
    this means p(0) = p(1) = 1. <br>
    for every i < n, p(i+1) >= p(i), because you can attach 1p to every solution to p(i). <br>
    so if i account for all coins like this we get p(n) = Σ꜀ p(n-c), for c in coins. <br>
    unfortunately this double counts many solutions i.e. one solution to p(4) is (2, 1, 1) and a solution to p(5) is (2, 2, 1) <br>
    the method described above would get (2, 1, 1, 2) as a solution to p(6) twice. (2, 1, 1) + (2) and (2, 2, 1) + (1)<br>
    <br> 
    this when i saw that all i had to do to stop double counting is make sure the coins picked in descending order. <br> 
    so if a coin c is picked, then no coin greater then c can be picked until the target is reached. <br>
    this ensures that all solutions which reach the target are unique. and therefore a simple recursive solution is applicable. <br>
    since target was not very big i didnt bother trying to optimise anymore, but i know this is a slow solution. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> 173 - Hollow Square Laminae I </p>
    how many hollow squares (see image below) can you construct using a million blocks? <br>
    <img style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 300px" src="projecteuler/limame squares example.png">
    <br>
    my first step was to draw a few little hollow squares to look for patterns. <br>
    i noticed the number of cells in the hollow square was easily calculatable if you know the side length of the "inner" and "outer" square. <br>
    num_cells = outerN² - innerN² <br>
    now all i needed to do was define an iterative process which checks all outer and inner N's until num_cells exceeded 1 million. <br>
    i settled on iterating through edge thickness and outerN in a nested while loop. <br> 
    i found this problem easier then expected and i think this is a pretty efficient method. <br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> 174 - Hollow Square Laminae II </p>
    this one just expanded on the last problem. its a bit of word salad: <br>
    If t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say t=8 is type L(1) and t=32 is type L(2). the type describes how many unique hollow squares you can construct for a given t. <br>
    Now let N(n) be the number of t ≤ 1e6 such that t is type L(n). What is Σₙ N(n) for n = 1-10? <br>
    <br>
    so thats a lot of words but what N(n) is asking is: how many numbers under 1 million can you construct n unique hollow squares with? <br>
    using the code from the previous problem this is rather trivial. all i did was create an array which will store how many unique hollow squares each t can create. <br>
    because of the way the algorithm works in the previous problem it is guaranteed to generate all hollow squares using less then 1 mil cells without duplicates. <br>
    once the array is generated i just wrote a small function to count how many elements in the array equal some target value. <br>
    then sum that from 1 - 10. dont be like me i spent like 10 minutes getting it wrong because i was looping from 0 - 10 instead :( <br>
