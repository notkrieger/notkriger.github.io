    some of my methods for solving some porject euler problems. <br>
    spoilers ahead if you want to try for yourself do not look at pictures. <br>
    it is very unlikely these are optimals solutions. <br><br>

    <p style="font-size: 24px;"> 31 - Coin Sums </p>
    how many ways can you make $2 using the following coins: 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, $1, $2 <br>
    <br>
    initial thoughts, i'll define p(n) to be the number of ways you can reach n using the set of coins. <br>
    this means p(0) = p(1) = 1. <br>
    for every i < n, p(i+1) >= p(i), because you can attach 1p to every solution to p(i). <br>
    so if i account for all coins like this we get p(n) = Σ꜀ p(n-c), for c in coins. <br>
    unfortunately this double counts many solutions i.e. one solution to p(4) is (2, 1, 1) and a solution to p(5) is (2, 2, 1) <br>
    the method described above would get (2, 1, 1, 2) as a solution to p(6) twice. (2, 1, 1) + (2) and (2, 2, 1) + (1)<br>
    <br> 
    this when i saw that all i had to do to stop double counting is make sure the coins picked in descending order. <br> 
    so if a coin c is picked, then no coin greater then c can be picked until the target is reached. <br>
    this ensures that all solutions which reach the target are unique. and therefore a simple recursive solution is applicable. <br>
    since target was only 200 with 8 coins i didnt bother trying to optimise anymore, but i know this is a slow solution. <br>
